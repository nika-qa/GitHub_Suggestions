# **Incorporating feedback in your pull request**

###### When reviewers suggest changes in a pull request, you can automatically incorporate the changes into the pull request or open an issue to track out-of-scope suggestions.

### Applying suggested changes

Other people can suggest specific changes to your pull request. You can apply these suggested changes directly in a pull request if you have write access to the repository. If the pull request was created from a fork and the author allowed edits from maintainers, you can also apply suggested changes if you have write access to the upstream repository. For more information, see "Commenting on a pull request" and "Allowing changes to a pull request branch created from a fork."

To quickly incorporate more than one suggested change into a single commit, you can also apply suggested changes as a batch. Applying one suggested change or a batch of suggested changes creates a single commit on the compare branch of the pull request.

Each person who suggested a change included in the commit will be a co-author of the commit. The person who applies the suggested changes will be a co-author and the committer of the commit. For more information about the term committer in Git, see "Git Basics - Viewing the Commit History" from the Pro Git book site.
